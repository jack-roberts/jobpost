10 Sept - Still need to:
- install docker, portainer and git on vps
- get designs for posts from mike - once happy with first one, get him to do Temp/Exec/Industrial and client one
- Add exec/industrial options onto form and code into app.py to support
- align images in app.py
- make it public, or on sharepoint?
